  abstract={Exploration in environments that are too hazardous or inaccessible to humans is one 
            of the most promising uses of robotics. In particular, natural environments that contain 
            granular media present a variety of challenges for the design and control of robots. Recently, 
            everting vine robots have been demonstrated that can navigate many different environments, 
            including digging in sand. However, everting vine robots typically rely on a tether which limits 
            their ability to explore. Here, we present an untethered, continuously everting soft robot for 
            exploration in granular media. We test the ability of this design to reduce the drag on the robot 
            while moving through granular media. We then investigate design features to improve the ability of 
            the robot to generate thrust in granular media, and validate them experimentally. Finally, We test our robot's ability to locomote and dig.},
