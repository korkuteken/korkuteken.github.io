Hi! I'm Korkut, a robotics engineer passionate about developing intelligent robotic systems. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and a Master's degree specializing in robotics and control from [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Throughout my education, I've got involved in variety of robotics projects and worked on both designing and programming robots. 

I have experience in Python, C/C++, ROS, and MATLAB in addition to control systems, state estimation, planning, and CAD modeling. I am excited to apply my skillset to tackle real-world challenges in robotics. Besides working on robots, I enjoy jumping out of perfectly fine airplanes 🪂, surfing 🏄‍♂️, snowboarding  🏂, and anything outdoors 🏕️. 

Check out my past projects and please feel free to reach out to discuss new opportunities!
