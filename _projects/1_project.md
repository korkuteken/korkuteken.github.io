To demonstrate working knowledge of Particle Filter for Robot Sensing and Estimation course, I have developed a SLAM algorithm in Python using Particle Filter and a publicly available dataset of an autonomous car with encoder readings, LiDAR scans, and fiber optic gyro (FOG) readings. Encoder readings and FOG readings were used to predict the position of the car and LiDAR scans were used to update this prediction. You can find the full report about the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qego6mW-FXTS6sMG6aNBBe6QvniU4BJ2/view">here</a>.
